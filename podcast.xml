            <![CDATA[This track is really, really simple and I like it that way. I got bogged down this week on how to record songs well, with drums, bass and three part harmony and it drove me crazy before realizing I didn’t have to do any of that. Sometimes simple is good.

This song is kind of negative, but it was also pretty cathartic to record. I’m going on a meditation retreat next week, so I’m spending a lot of time thinking about the thing that is me and who I want to become. I’ll get there, just like you.

Speaking of retreat, not sure how I’m going to release the track next week since I’ll be gone. It may be released before or after, but I won’t miss a week, I promise you that.

            <![CDATA[Week 10! And it figures this is the first one that I’m a day late.

This one was written this week because I wanted something funky. Not saying I know how to be funky, but this song is kinda funky – in more ways than one. Enjoy!

            <![CDATA[I remember getting out of rehearsals for the Gershwin play “Crazy for You” when I got a text from my mom telling me there was a shooting at Virginia Tech. I was 16, a year from applying to college and getting shot was the last thing on my mind in a rural hometown. Now, years later, it’s only gotten worse and I had completely given up on it ever getting fixed – that is until these kids from Florida started talking. This is the first time, in my memory, that students have been taken seriously in this conversation and it makes me so, so thankful.

I’ve spent this entire project talking for myself, thought I’d try on what it’d feel like to give someone else a chance to speak. Thanks, enjoy, call your representatives. I just did.

This was written about a month ago in my car while waiting for a nail appointment. The nails didn’t turn out well, but I think the song did. Enjoy!

            <![CDATA[This is an old song; a rare old-song gem that doesn’t completely embarrass me. I wrote it in Pittsburgh in 2014 at 2am, alone in my apartment, for a band that broke up a few weeks after learning how to play it. This one has some yelling over acoustic instruments which is so like me, I know.

This week marks the end of a full month of doing this nonsense and, you know, it ain’t getting easier, but it’s getting more fun.

I also got some rad new gear this week that should prove useful going forward and you can hear on this song. So, hopefully the quality is better despite the song quality being dubious.

Enjoy!

            <![CDATA[Sometimes you make a song and you think it’s about one thing until you play it for a crowd. Earlier this week, I played this song at my weekly open mic and I got an emotional reaction from someone I admire greatly. Someone who treats art with the utmost respect and I love them so dearly and I aspire to be more like them. So, this song goes out to that person; you know who you are.

This song has piano, which is new for me. In general, I’m not good at it, but I can keep time and make things happen if I figure out chords and go from there.

            <![CDATA[I’ve spent a lot of time this year volunteering with a hospice. It’s an odd gig. Sitting in with people who are dying in the next six months. They know their days are numbered and they have an opportunity to make peace with that. Some do, some don’t, some are massively depressed, and some act like nothing is different. It’s made me realize that I want to know I’m dying. I don’t want it to be sudden, I want to know it’s name and follow it through.

This song has been brewing for a while and I’m happy with the way it came out. It’s kind of a sleepy one. Enjoy.

            <![CDATA[Ahem. Is this thing on? Welcome to Week #1. This week’s song is called “Let Me In” and I’m trying to not be overly precious about it. I say “try” because I’m fighting an intense urge to go back and edit it right now or re-record vocals or scrap this entire idea. But that’s exactly why I’m uploading as is.

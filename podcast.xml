            <![CDATA[Sometimes you make a song and you think it’s about one thing until you play it for a crowd. Earlier this week, I played this song at my weekly open mic and I got an emotional reaction from someone I admire greatly. Someone who treats art with the utmost respect and I love them so dearly and I aspire to be more like them. So, this song goes out to that person; you know who you are.

This song has piano, which is new for me. In general, I’m not good at it, but I can keep time and make things happen if I figure out chords and go from there.

            <![CDATA[I’ve spent a lot of time this year volunteering with a hospice. It’s an odd gig. Sitting in with people who are dying in the next six months. They know their days are numbered and they have an opportunity to make peace with that. Some do, some don’t, some are massively depressed, and some act like nothing is different. It’s made me realize that I want to know I’m dying. I don’t want it to be sudden, I want to know it’s name and follow it through.

This song has been brewing for a while and I’m happy with the way it came out. It’s kind of a sleepy one. Enjoy.

I say “try” because I’m fighting an intense urge to go back and edit it right now or re-record vocals or scrap this entire idea. But that’s exactly why I’m uploading as is.

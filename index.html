         Go West, Die Young</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;16 | Apr 25, 2018 – Folk</h3><p>This song was written last year after a friend died. They died suddenly, unexpectedly, and it was a shock when it happened. This week is the 1 year anniversary of their death and I’ve been kind of saving this song for this week.</p>

<p>They weren’t the kind of friend who I kept up with often or went and got coffee when we crossed paths. They were the kind of person that just knowing they existed on this planet was more than enough. They moved away from home, out west, around the same time I did and we spent a lot of time talking about how different it was out here and how nice it was to get away from it all. I wish they were still around; the world needs more good people.</p>

<p>This one goes out to C. I love you and miss you.</p>

         Frankly, My Dear</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;15 | Apr 18, 2018 – NoiseRock</h3><p>Return to form! Still kinda sick, but it’s getting better every day. This week, I decided to leave it all on the court and write my first, legit, noise rock song. I listen to a lot of noise rock; The Paper Chase, Dananananaykroyd, Dismemberment Plan, Future of the Left. These bands redefined what rock could sound like; it can be tonally unreasonable and beautiful.</p>

<p>So, disclaimer; this song has a lot of screaming. If that’s not your thing, still give it a listen, keep an open mind.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;14 | Apr 11, 2018 – punk</h3><p>Sometimes, things conspire to make sure you’re not on your game. Work, travel, friends, sickness, or just lack of energy; any of those can knock you off your pedestal. It’s possible that I’ve experienced all of these roadblocks this week and I’m still here, albeit a little haggard.</p>

<p>I’m writing this with a fever and a 3 and half hour drive ahead of me and I’m pretty wrecked. So, enjoy this track despite it’s flaws. Back to form next week, I hope! Enjoy.</p>

<p>(With all that said, there is a redesign, so that’s something!)</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;13 | Apr 4, 2018 – punk</h3><p>Week 13? Week 14? Hard to say because I missed last week for legitimately wonderful reasons. I took a 10 day silent meditation retreat via dhamma.org and I’d suggest it to basically anyone with an interest in meditation. It was difficult – incredibly difficult – but so wonderful and catalyzing.</p>

<p>So, this song was written in my mind during last week, scribbled on contraband scraps of paper in between sessions. I hope you like it!</p>

<p>But this one is dear to my heart and a sort of lullaby for myself. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;11 | Mar 13, 2018 – punk</h3><p>This track is really, really simple and I like it that way. I got bogged down this week on how to record songs well, with drums, bass and three part harmony and it drove me crazy before realizing I didn’t <em>have</em> to do any of that. Sometimes simple is good.</p>

<p>This song is kind of negative, but it was also pretty cathartic to record. I’m going on a meditation retreat next week, so I’m spending a lot of time thinking about the thing that is <em>me</em> and who I want to become. I’ll get there, just like you.</p>

<p>Speaking of retreat, not sure how I’m going to release the track next week since I’ll be gone. It may be released before or after, but I won’t miss a week, I promise you that.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;9 | Feb 27, 2018 – rock</h3><p>I remember getting out of rehearsals for the Gershwin play “<em>Crazy for You</em>” when I got a text from my mom telling me there was a shooting at Virginia Tech. I was 16, a year from applying to college and getting shot was the last thing on my mind in a rural hometown. Now, years later, it’s only gotten worse and I had completely given up on it ever getting fixed – that is until these kids from Florida started talking. This is the first time, in my memory, that students have been taken seriously in this conversation and it makes me so, so thankful.</p>

<p>I’ve spent this entire project talking for myself, thought I’d try on what it’d feel like to give someone else a chance to speak. Thanks, enjoy, call your representatives. I just did.</p>

<p>This was written about a month ago in my car while waiting for a nail appointment. The nails didn’t turn out well, but I think the song did. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;5 | Jan 31, 2018 – folk</h3><p>This is an old song; a rare old-song gem that doesn’t completely embarrass me. I wrote it in Pittsburgh in 2014 at 2am, alone in my apartment, for a band that broke up a few weeks after learning how to play it. This one has some yelling over acoustic instruments which is <em>so</em> like me, I know.</p>

<p>This week marks the end of a full month of doing this nonsense and, you know, it ain’t getting easier, but it’s getting more fun.</p>

<p>I also got some rad new gear this week that should prove useful going forward and you can hear on this song. So, hopefully the quality is better despite the song quality being dubious.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

         Hold Your Breath</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;4 | Jan 23, 2018 – piano</h3><p>Sometimes you make a song and you think it’s about one thing until you play it for a crowd. Earlier this week, I played this song at my weekly open mic and I got an emotional reaction from someone I admire greatly. Someone who treats art with the utmost respect and I love them so dearly and I aspire to be more like them. So, this song goes out to that person; you know who you are.</p>

<p>This song has piano, which is new for me. In general, I’m not good at it, but I can keep time and make things happen if I figure out chords and go from there.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;2 | Jan 7, 2018 – folk</h3><p>I’ve spent a lot of time this year volunteering with a hospice. It’s an odd gig. Sitting in with people who are dying in the next six months. They know their days are numbered and they have an opportunity to make peace with that. Some do, some don’t, some are massively depressed, and some act like nothing is different. It’s made me realize that I want to know I’m dying. I don’t want it to be sudden, I want to know it’s name and follow it through.</p>

<p>This song has been brewing for a while and I’m happy with the way it came out. It’s kind of a sleepy one. Enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;34 | Sep 4, 2018 – rock</h3><p>Mornin’ everyone. Hope you had a good labor day, I sure did. Here’s song #34, which is still wild that I’m saying I’ve written 34 songs this year.</p>

<p>This track is about working too hard for no benefit. Still trying to find that work-life balance.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;33 | Aug 26, 2018 – folk</h3><p>I went on the retreat. It was difficult and wonderful and I need more of it in my life, but for now I need to sleep.</p>

<p>This song was written in my head over the span of the retreat, scribbled, once again, on contraband paper – maybe on next year’s retreat I’ll actually follow the rules and not hide a notebook.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;32 | Aug 19, 2018 – punk</h3><p>Another week, another song. I’m losing gusto, y’all. Not just with songs, but with everything in general. I’m working a lot, running a lot, recording a lot and generally just doing a lot. That’s a good thing, normally, but I’ve been really prone to burnout this year. This is my 4th or 5th burnout this year, which can’t be good for my heart.</p>

<p>I’m going to a 5 day meditation retreat this week to serve and share my love of meditation by cooking good vegan food and cleaning bathrooms. I can’t complain because someone did the same for me earlier this year. So, hopefully meditating 3 hours a day for a couple of days will do me a lot of good.</p>

<p>This song has been brewing a while, but I finally got it out of me this week. I’m doing some gear selling/buying in the next few weeks, so I’ll probably be doing a lot more acoustic pieces for the rest of the month. I’ll try to make it worth your while.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;30 | Aug 4, 2018 – punk</h3><p>This week’s been weird. I’m working a lot and running a lot, but all I want to do is write music. Music didn’t feel that way last year; it felt like a thing I did for fun. Now it feels like it runs my life – possibly in a good way. Send my music to your friends, I wanna quit my job.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is an old noise track given new life. Also, inexplicably, about heaven’s gate. I’m gettin’ very cult-y lately.</p>

         True Compass</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;29 | Jul 28, 2018 – punk</h3><p>This track is going up late because I went on a roadtrip with some friends this week. We’ve known each other since we were kids; we went to shows; broke hearts; and somehow ended up together still. Each of us have changed in a bunch of ways and stayed exactly the same in others. It’s always interesting to see what time does to people.</p>

<p>“True Compass” is about using power to do damage to others even though you know it’s a bad move. I have violent tendencies – anyone who knows me knows that – but I’m doing everything I can to keep that from being the only thing about me.</p>

It may never come out. Magnolium is, for sure, the worst song on the album, so I decided to do the the worst cover of it. It’s kind of like The Chariot, but if Josh Scogin wasn’t Christian and more disappointing.</p>

These words have been in the back of my head for a while, but it took a good therapy session this week and a lot of shitty hands of fate to make them make sense.

         A Healthy Appetite</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;25 | Jun 27, 2018 – pop</h3><p>I started seeing a therapist this week for the first time in a couple of years. He’s solid; just as good as my previous one, which are big shoes to fill. I was struck by how similar seeing a therapist is to agreeing to be eaten by a german cannibal. You meet a stranger who you’ve only talked to over email; you sign a couple of contracts; and then you spill your guts despite having no common history.</p>

<p>So, that’s what this song is about getting eaten by a cannibal/seeing a therapist and being unsure if you’re doing the right thing or if it’s all in your head. Enjoy!</p>

         Disappointing, but Sexy</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;23 | Jun 13, 2018 – punk</h3><p>Hello! I really wanted to make a hardcore song this week, but all I could come up with was this sweet funk lick. Soooo, I used it anyway.</p>

<p>This song is about an acquaintance who is obsessed with partying, fame, and living a glamorous lifestyle even if, admittedly, it means dying young and alienating people. This song is not so much about <em>their</em> life, but imagining what my life would look like if I decided to live that way.</p>

         The Wasatch Mountains</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;22 | Jun 8, 2018 – folk</h3><p>I was on vacation this past week with my grandparents and it was wonderful and tiring and exactly what my heart needed. This is a song I wish I had written on a week where I had more time. More time to record; more time to edit; more time for anything other than a one-shot recording and no additional instrumentation, but that’s the name of this game. There’s totally supposed to be a harmonica solo during the whistling solo.</p>

<p>This song is about The Oregon Trail and it feels like a campfire song that that one Scoutmaster would sing at Goshen Scout Camp. I just got the handheld version of the game and it’s all I did on the flight home. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;21 | May 29, 2018 – Ambient</h3><p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned in the process of doing this project, it’s that I’m learning to love my flaws. Or at least tolerate them. I’m not a natural born poet or a <em>great</em> singer. I’m not a trained anything; I’m a guy with an interest in getting better at music. I don’t want to be famous, I just don’t want to die having given up on the one thing I liked the most.</p>

<p>I wrote this song twice. The first time it was a weirdly fast folk song and I didn’t like where it went. Maybe I’ll release that later this year as an addendum. Anyway, enjoy.</p>

This is by a San Francisco based artist named “Wisdom Tooth” who I was addicted to one summer in 2013. I listened to their music non-stop and became the soundtrack of my senior year. This song has always stuck with me because I grew up in a country music household and it describes my relationship to my family better than I probably could.</p>

<p>So, this song goes out to Meagan Day; thanks for the music.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;20 | May 23, 2018 – ska</h3><p>This song has been floating around in my life for a while, but it’s gotten new meaning since moving to Las Vegas. I’ve never been a partier; in college I never went to bars unless there was a show that night. In Las Vegas, I’ve been to the most incredible, well-produced night clubs in the world and I realllllly hate them. They always strike me as sad in a way I can’t place; it’s probably because I feel out of place at them and can’t imagine enjoying them in earnest.</p>

<p>This song is NSFW, it has naughty words and suggestive content. So, bear that mind.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;17 | May 2, 2018 – folk</h3><p>I was born with a stutter, so my parents put me in the church choir classes to learn how to breathe. I bet I wanted to as well, but they pushed me because the doctors said it would help. If I didn’t have a stutter, I would have never written a song; I would have never been in a choir; I would have never met my partner. That stutter has plagued me my whole life and, you know, I’d choose music and love over the ability to comfortably approach strangers in Safeway.</p>

<p>My partner always says I’m bad with change, but I think I’m bad at decision-making . Should I do this thing or that thing or change careers or keep the one I got or become a vegetarian or try keto. I’m just trying shit right now and, you know, it hasn’t gone too badly.</p>

<p>This song was written in the last 24 hours, enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;16 | Apr 25, 2018 – folk</h3><p>This song was written last year after a friend died. They died suddenly, unexpectedly, and it was a shock when it happened. This week is the 1 year anniversary of their death and I’ve been kind of saving this song for this week.</p>

<p>They weren’t the kind of friend who I kept up with often or went and got coffee when we crossed paths. They were the kind of person that just knowing they existed on this planet was more than enough. They moved away from home, out west, around the same time I did and we spent a lot of time talking about how different it was out here and how nice it was to get away from it all. I wish they were still around; the world needs more good people.</p>

<p>This one goes out to C. I love you and miss you.</p>

This week, I decided to leave it all on the court and write my first, legit, noise rock song. I listen to a lot of noise rock; The Paper Chase, Dananananaykroyd, Dismemberment Plan, Future of the Left. These bands redefined what rock could sound like; it can be tonally unreasonable and beautiful.</p>

<p>So, disclaimer; this song has a lot of screaming. If that’s not your thing, still give it a listen, keep an open mind.</p>

<p>I’m writing this with a fever and a 3 and half hour drive ahead of me and I’m pretty wrecked. So, enjoy this track despite it’s flaws. Back to form next week, I hope! Enjoy.</p>

<p>(With all that said, there is a redesign, so that’s something!)</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;13 | Apr 4, 2018 – punk</h3><p>Week 13? Week 14? Hard to say because I missed last week for legitimately wonderful reasons. I took a 10 day silent meditation retreat via dhamma.org and I’d suggest it to basically anyone with an interest in meditation. It was difficult – incredibly difficult – but so wonderful and catalyzing.</p>

<p>So, this song was written in my mind during last week, scribbled on contraband scraps of paper in between sessions. I hope you like it!</p>

<p>But this one is dear to my heart and a sort of lullaby for myself. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;11 | Mar 14, 2018 – punk</h3><p>This track is really, really simple and I like it that way. I got bogged down this week on how to record songs well, with drums, bass and three part harmony and it drove me crazy before realizing I didn’t <em>have</em> to do any of that. Sometimes simple is good.</p>

<p>This song is kind of negative, but it was also pretty cathartic to record. I’m going on a meditation retreat next week, so I’m spending a lot of time thinking about the thing that is <em>me</em> and who I want to become. I’ll get there, just like you.</p>

<p>Speaking of retreat, not sure how I’m going to release the track next week since I’ll be gone. It may be released before or after, but I won’t miss a week, I promise you that.</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;9 | Feb 27, 2018 – rock</h3><p>I remember getting out of rehearsals for the Gershwin play “<em>Crazy for You</em>” when I got a text from my mom telling me there was a shooting at Virginia Tech. I was 16, a year from applying to college and getting shot was the last thing on my mind in a rural hometown. Now, years later, it’s only gotten worse and I had completely given up on it ever getting fixed – that is until these kids from Florida started talking. This is the first time, in my memory, that students have been taken seriously in this conversation and it makes me so, so thankful.</p>

<p>I’ve spent this entire project talking for myself, thought I’d try on what it’d feel like to give someone else a chance to speak. Thanks, enjoy, call your representatives. I just did.</p>

<p>This was written about a month ago in my car while waiting for a nail appointment. The nails didn’t turn out well, but I think the song did. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;5 | Jan 31, 2018 – folk</h3><p>This is an old song; a rare old-song gem that doesn’t completely embarrass me. I wrote it in Pittsburgh in 2014 at 2am, alone in my apartment, for a band that broke up a few weeks after learning how to play it. This one has some yelling over acoustic instruments which is <em>so</em> like me, I know.</p>

<p>This week marks the end of a full month of doing this nonsense and, you know, it ain’t getting easier, but it’s getting more fun.</p>

<p>I also got some rad new gear this week that should prove useful going forward and you can hear on this song. So, hopefully the quality is better despite the song quality being dubious.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Week &#35;4 | Jan 23, 2018 – piano</h3><p>Sometimes you make a song and you think it’s about one thing until you play it for a crowd. Earlier this week, I played this song at my weekly open mic and I got an emotional reaction from someone I admire greatly. Someone who treats art with the utmost respect and I love them so dearly and I aspire to be more like them. So, this song goes out to that person; you know who you are.</p>

<p>This song has piano, which is new for me. In general, I’m not good at it, but I can keep time and make things happen if I figure out chords and go from there.</p>

         How Odd, How Suspect</a></h2>
    <h3>Week &#35;2 | Jan 7, 2018 – folk</h3><p>I’ve spent a lot of time this year volunteering with a hospice. It’s an odd gig. Sitting in with people who are dying in the next six months. They know their days are numbered and they have an opportunity to make peace with that. Some do, some don’t, some are massively depressed, and some act like nothing is different. It’s made me realize that I want to know I’m dying. I don’t want it to be sudden, I want to know it’s name and follow it through.</p>

<p>This song has been brewing for a while and I’m happy with the way it came out. It’s kind of a sleepy one. Enjoy.</p>
